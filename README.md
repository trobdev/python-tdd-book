# python-tdd-book

This code is from the book Test-Driven Development with Python by Harry Percival, which can be purchased on Amazon or any comparable book store.

This repository is simply following along with course curriculum in the book and going step-by-step.  I don't claim any of this code, I'm just practicing and learning with it.
